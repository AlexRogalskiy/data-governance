# Repository compliance

Integration of an existing metadata repository into the open metadata and governance ecosystem is implemented by 
an OMRS repository connector and an OMRS reposiotry event mapper.  These two components are hosted in a special 
server called a repository proxy.   Together they translate API calls and events between the existing repository's 
proprietary APIs and formats and the open metadata formats.

The ODPi Egeria compliance suite includes a suite of tests that validate the behaviour of these connectors.
