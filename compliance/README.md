# open-metadata-compliance

The base open metadata and governance capability is describes on the apache Atlas wiki: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ATLAS/Open+Metadata+and+Governance

Part of the compliance work is clear documentation on how to built compliant services and content.  The initial phase of work is to create 3 guides:

* How to write a content pack
* How to integrate a proprietary metadata repository into the open metadata ecosystem.
* How to select and call an open metadata access service
