# Egeria Semantics workgroup 20th of February

## Agenda:
* Michal to present assessment of model formats and propose options that would be useful for Egeria to adopt - so we can discuss and get consensus.               
* AOB 

## Attendees:
* David Radley (IBM)
* Graham Wallis (IBM)
* Michal Miklas (IBM)
* Stefhan Van Hevoirt (ING)
* Oana Turbatu (ING)
* Chris Replogle (SAS)
* Pat O'Sullivan (IBM)

## Minutes:
* Michal presented his investigations on model elements and CIM. [Presentation](../documents/20th%20Feb%202020%20json-ld-rdf-im-proposal.pptx). 
* Michal talked of the various namespace elements that he thought could be used in a model. The idea would be that this model would then be parsed and converted in Egeria content;
 glossary terms and term to term relationships for an ontology.
* Michal talked of a minimum set of types that Egeria would need to support. 
* In parallel with this activity Michal is converting industry models to the CIM format. 
* Stefhan asked whether there could be common model content for example for data of birth. Pat thought this was a good idea, but was aware that particular domains 
(e.g. banking vs insurance) like to represent things in a particular way and may be difficult to to get consensus on common terms.    
 
## Next session:
Daniela and Barry from ING to present their findings / thoughts around metadata driven security, especially around how to create models including subject areas,
to feed into security tags to drive authorization.
