# data-privacy-pack

How would an organization comply with data protection/data privacy regulation such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation? This type of legislation can have far-reaching impacts on the way that the organization operates and an organization's response needs to be carefully planned and rolled out consistently across multiple groups within the organization - otherwise the organization may waste a lot of time and effort without actually becoming compliant.

The aim of the ODPi data privacy pack is to provide support to a person responsible for implementing data privacy in an organization. We refer to this role as the Data Privacy Officer. The pack supports the following phases in the Data Privacy Officer's work:

* Understanding the different pieces of legislation and where they apply (eg which geographies or types of data).
    
* Preparing and documenting definitions, classifications and related metadata to support privacy.
    
* Planning a Campaign (series of projects) to roll out changes to the organization and its IT systems to support privacy.
    
* Working with new project teams on new uses of personal data (eg a new IT service or product offering that uses personal data).
    
* Assessing the current state of compliance.
    
* Rehearsing different scenarios such as data breach incidents and data subject requests.
    
* Reacting to/managing real privacy incidents as they occur.

The pack is made up of documentation and pre-built metadata elements that can be loaded into an open metadata compliant repository and shared across a metadata repository cluster.

Progress for the data privacy pack is managed through JIRA DG-1 https://jira.odpi.org/browse/DG-1
