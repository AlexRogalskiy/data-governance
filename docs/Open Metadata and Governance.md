# Open Metadata and Governance

Open metadata and governance creates an open enterprise-wide metadata management and governance capability.
This capability enables data tools, engines and platforms from different open source projects and vendors to share metadata
and notifications to enable an organization to have a complete view of their data assets while taking advantage of the
appropiate technology for its business.

Open metadata and governance provides a comprehensive set of standards that cover the capabilities necessary for an organization to
get maximum use of its data whilst being compliant with all of the necessary regulations.

These standards include APIs and event (notification) formats, frameworks for customization, a reference implementation to 
speed up vendor adoption.

One of the objectives of the project is to ensure it is as easy as possible for vendors to encorporate the
appropriate parts of the open metadata and governance capability into their product suite as possible.
This means the libraries are built around a set of frameworks that allow plug-ins for different platform options and vendor value-add.

The next assumption is that software products are bought and installed by communities within an organization for
specific purposes (eg project, organizational function etc).
The ecosystem needs to operate as a peer-to-peer network of products with minimal centeralised infrastructure
to allow different parts of an organization to buy the products they need and still connect into the
broader metadata exchange.  This allows the open metadata and governance capability to grow without the need for
centralised purchasing decisions.  

Finally, open metadata and governance aims to lower the barrier of entry for open metadata and governance.
This applies both to vendors and organizations that have data assets.
This means that the open metadata and governance reference implementation includes fully baked servers that can
support the metadata management and governance of a small to medium enterprises (or dept within an enterprise).

New vendor product can also be built using these servers since the vendor is able take the open metadata and governance libraries
as the basis of their product and plug-in their value add to create a new offering.
