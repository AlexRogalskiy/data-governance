# Planning for common data definitions

Part of [Jules Keeper's](../../personas/jules-keeper.md) [data strategy](../creating-the-data-strategy/README.md)
includes creating common data definitions.
The board of Coco Pharmaceuticals asked for more details on what this means,
how they would be defined and used as well as the likely cost.

Working with [Erin Overview](../../personas/erin-overview.md), they seek to outline the following questions:
* What is a common data definition?
* How does it help the business?
* How are common data definitions created and managed?
* How are common data definitions used in analytics tools, such as those used by the data science teams?
* How are common data definitions use in the IT systems?
