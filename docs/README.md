# Welcome to ODPi data-governance

There is a lot going on in the field of data governance, due to the increased use of data intensive applications and
the corresponding rise in regulations around safe data use.

Traditional approaches to Data Governance developed for the Enterprise Data Warehouse are failing because they are too rigid for today's use cases.  However, many of the tools and techniques used in these programs are still valuable. 

The ODPi Data Governance Project helps organizations adopt hollistic governance practices for data and the digital services that use them.  These practices consider (1) the people involved, (2) the data they need to make good decisions, (3) the processes they need to follow and (4) the technology that automates much of the routine work.

Open and integrated data tools, engines and data management platforms are key to this vision.  
**ODPi Egeria** is a sister project to ODPi Data Governance that provides the 
[open standards and services](https://odpi.github.io/data-governance/Open-Metadata-and-Governance) for more information
to support the data governance approach outlined in these governance paractices.
