# Welcome to ODPi data-governance

There is a lot going on in the field of data governance,
due to the increased use of data intensive applications and
the corresponding rise in regulations around safe data use.

The Data Governance PMC is seeking to help organizations
adopt good data governance practices through the use of open
data tools, engines and data management platforms.
These technologies may be from different vendors but they
are able to exchange metadata and manage cross-enterprise
data governance through the use of Egeria
[Open Metadata and Governance Open Source capability](https://odpi.github.io/data-governance/Open-Metadata-and-Governance).  

It also seeks to help vendors adopt the open metadata and governance capability in their software products to improve their data management capabilities through an open and integrated ecosystem. 

We are still in start up mode so as you explore the git hub files you will see skeletons of the different initiatives. There is also a [slack channel](https://odpi.slack.com/messages/C7E9FB0LT) that you can join (you need a linux foundation userid to log on) and you are welcome to join our weekly calls. They are Thursday 9:00am to 10:00am US Eastern and the meeting minutes are published on this wiki.
