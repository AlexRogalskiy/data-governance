# Welcome to ODPi data-governance

There is a lot going on in the field of data governance,
due to the increased use of data intensive applications and
the corresponding rise in regulations around safe data use.

The ODPi Data Governance Project helps organizations
adopt good data governance practices through the use of open
data tools, engines and data management platforms.

It is a sister project to **ODPi Egeria** - see
[Open Metadata and Governance](https://odpi.github.io/data-governance/Open-Metadata-and-Governance).  

We are still in start up mode so as you explore the GitHub files you will see skeletons of the different initiatives. There is also a [slack channel](https://odpi.slack.com/messages/C7E9FB0LT) that you can join (you need a linux foundation userid to log on) and you are welcome to join our weekly calls. They are Thursday 9:00am to 10:00am US Eastern and the meeting minutes are published on this wiki.
