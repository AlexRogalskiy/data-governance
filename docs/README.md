# Welcome to ODPi Egeria's Guidance on Governance (GoG) Pages

There is a lot of interest in governance topics such the fairness of AI;
ownership of data;
cross-organization and cross-boarder sharing of data;
cyber-security and data privacy.
This interest is driven by the increased use of digital services and
personal data that spans multiple aspects of an individual's life.

Governments have responded with more exacting regulation that demands greater
transparency in an organization's operation and provision for individual's rights
relating to their data and their treatment by automated processes.
The European Union's
[General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://ec.europa.eu/commission/priorities/justice-and-fundamental-rights/data-protection/2018-reform-eu-data-protection-rules_en) is a
well-known example.

Although seeming to fit in the purview of **data governance**,
the impact of these regulations is much broader,
covering the process for designing and building
software, the secure operation of IT systems, data privacy as well as
the traditional data management concerns.

ODPi Egeria is dedicated to helping organizations build out their
broader governance capability around their digital services to meet these
new challenges.  At is core is the
[Egeria Open Metadata and Governance software](https://github.com/odpi/egeria)
that provides the technology to support governance.
Egeria's **Guidance on Governance (GoG)**
provides guidance to help you design an effective and holistic governance
capability in your organization.

The GoG considers (1) the people involved, (2) the data they need
to make good decisions, (3) the processes they need to follow and (4)
the technology that automates much of the routine work.

The guidance is in two streams.  There is a theoretical set of guidance that
covers various governance topics in general terms.
Then there is a parallel set of material that chronicles a fictitious
organization called [Coco Pharmaceuticals](coco-pharmaceuticals)
as they create a governance capability that will support and drive
their business transformation to delivering personalized medicine.

The two streams cross-reference each other and include links to
software samples using the ODPi Egeria software.

scenarios that are driving the work of the Egeria community.
* [Governance of Data](governance-of-data) explains what makes data governance particularly challenging. 
* [Governance Maturity Model](maturity-model) shows the technological development of the
governance technology needed by an organization to broaden its use of data.
* [Common Data Definitions](common-data-definitions) describes how to build a glossary of standard terms.
