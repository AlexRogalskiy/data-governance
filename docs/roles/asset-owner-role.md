# Asset Owner Role

![Icon](asset-owner-role.png)

Asset owners are individuals that own one or more of the following:
* A data set
* A system that processes and stores data
* A digital service that uses data sets and systems to support a
service offered by the business.  This digital service may be either
for internal or external use.

Most employees in an organization will be an owner of at least one asset.
The size and importance of the asset in question will determine the level
of seniority of
the individual that is the asset owner.

The asset owner is responsible for investment decision related to
the asset.  This includes decisions to extend or update the asset and when
to dispose of it.  
They also make choices on investment in security infrastructure
and support verses new function.

As such the governance team need to ensure that the asset owner is
responsible for planning for the asset as well
it functionality.

Assets can be transferred between owners.
However, there should never be a time when the asset has no owner.

Some assets are composed, or are dependent on assets owned by different
people.  The asset owner of the composite is responsible for
ensuring the consumed assets that are used according to their
license and service level agreements.

For example, for digital services and systems, the asset owner makes choices
relating to the types of data that are
collected by their offering, the processing that is
performed on data,
what data is stored, shared and how long is it kept.
