# Architect Role

![Icon](architect-role.png)

The architect is responsible for the structural design of digital systems
ensuring it is fit for purpose, resilient, secure and cost effective.

Typically, there is an architect responsible for the design of a digital
service.  This covers the interfaces, data and infrastructure.

## Architect Specialities

As organizations and the number of IT systems grows, specialisms in architecture
emerge.  For example,

* **Enterprise Architect**
There are architects that take an enterprise view - looking at how the
systems and organization around then are supporting the organization's need.
These are called enterprise architects.

* **Information Architect**
There are architects that focus on the structure and flow of information
around the organization.  They are called information architects.

These architects then complement the architects assigned to digital services.
