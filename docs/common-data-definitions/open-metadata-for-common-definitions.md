# Open metadata for common data definitions

The [ODPi Egeria project](https://odpi.github.io/egeria/) provides a comprehensive set of
[open metadata types](https://odpi.github.io/egeria/open-metadata-publication/website/open-metadata-types/)
for managing [common data definitions](README.md).  These types provide a common language and format for exchanging
these definitions between tools and metadata repositories.  Each tool/repository provides a mapping to the ODPi Egeria types
and Egeria manages the exchange of metadata between these parties.

## The glossary

The glossary is at the heart of the common data definitions.
Figure 1 shows that the glossary contains glossary terms.  Each term describes a concept used by the business.
