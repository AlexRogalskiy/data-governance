# Data Citizenship with ODPi Egeria

[ODPi Egeria](https://egeria.odpi.org/) provides libraries and integration servers to simplify the
integration of metadata repositories and governance functions.

It provides an extensible, open metadata type system that covers most if not all of the types of metadata that
an organization needs to exchange, APIs and event formats to support the exchange of metadata along with
embeddable libraries that support the underlying protocols.

Figure 1 shows an example of using the egeria technology (shown in bright blue) to integrate metadata repositories
and governance functions.  Notice that the egeria libraries are embedded in many technologies, and there are also servers
(called Open Metadata and Governance (OMAG) servers) that provide governance APIs to different types of tools.
