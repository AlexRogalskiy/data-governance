# Data Governance Maturity Model

The data governance maturity model was first published in 2018:

> REDP5486 The Journey Continues: from Data Lake to Data-Driven Organization
>
> http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/abstracts/redp5486.html?Open

It shows five levels of maturity that build on one another until the organization is able to support
a wide range of advanced data use along with
appropriate self-service access to data for a majority of people in the organization.
This is the capability that Forrester calls 
[Data Citizenship](https://www.forrester.com/webinar/Data+Governance+20+The+Journey+Toward+Data+Citizenship/-/E-WEB21683).
The levels are:

* **Data Awareness** - where is the organization's data and what does it contain?
* **Governance Awareness** - how should data be governed?
* **Emdedded Governance** - how can governance be automated?
* **Business Driven Governance** - how can the business leaders take ownership of data and governance?
* **Data Citizenship** - how can every employee, system and server get the data they need, every day?
