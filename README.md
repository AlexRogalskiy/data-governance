# data-governance
The ODPi Data Governance PMC develops collateral to encourage adoption of the open metadata and governance standards.  
These standards are provided through the ODPi Egeria open source project.
Egeria provides the reference implementation of these standards that are packaged into reusable libraries for vendors to include.  

The ODPi Data Governance PMC focuses on adoption by:
* Supporting vendors wishing to support the open metadata and governance capability.
* Providing governance best practices that help to accelerate an organization's data governance program through adoption of open metadata and governance.

This GitHub site is used for developing collateral.  To see our latest completed material, see [Data Governance Best Practices](https://odpi.github.io/data-governance/).
