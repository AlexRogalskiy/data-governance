# data-governance
The ODPi Data Governance PMC develops collateral to encourage adoption of the open metadata and governance standards.  
These standards are described on the Apache Atlas wiki here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ATLAS/Open+Metadata+and+Governance.
The Apache Atlas open source project provides the reference implementation of these standards that are packaged into reusable libraries for vendors to include.  It also supports a full stack metadata repository.

The ODPi Data Governance PMC focuses on adoption by:
* Supporting vendors wishing to support the open metadata and governance capability.
* Supporting organizations to accelerate their data governance program through the open metadata and governance capability.

This GitHub site is used for developing collateral.  To see our latest completed material, please visit: https://www.odpi.org/projects/data-governance-pmc
